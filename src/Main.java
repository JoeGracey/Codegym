public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	    /*
	    Create the Dog class. The dog should have a String name and int age.
	    Create getters and setters for all the variables of the Dog class.

	    Requirements:

	    - The program must not read data from the keyboard.
	    - The Dog class must have a String variable name.
	    - The Dog class must have an int variable age.
	    - The class must have a getter for the variable name and variable age.
	    - The class must have a setter for the variable name and variable age.

	    This is the code that I am given with the assignment:

	    public class Dog {

	        public static void main(String[] args) {

	        }
	    }
	     */
    }
}
